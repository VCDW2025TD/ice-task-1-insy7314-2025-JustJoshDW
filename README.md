SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that secure communication over networks, with TLS being the modern, more secure successor to SSL. And while they serve the same purpose, TLS offers stronger encryption algorithms and improved authentication methods compared to SSL. Therefore HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because it uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data, preventing attackers from intercepting or tampering with sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. I found that Without SSL/TLS, web applications are vulnerable to risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks, data leaks, and unauthorized access. Real-world incidents, such as the Equifax breach and cases where companies accidentally deployed sites without proper SSL, highlight the severe consequences of misconfigured or missing encryption. Overall, SSL/TLS is critical for protecting user trust and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of online communications.
